This study explores the development of an innovative transradial prosthesis, incorporating EEG sensor technology to enhance user control and functionality. Emphasizing a user-centric approach, the project integrates advanced biomechanical principles with state-of-the-art additive manufacturing techniques. EEG-based brain controlled prosthetic arm is a non-invasive technique that can serve as a powerful aid for severely disabled people in their daily life. This paper presents the design process, calibration methodologies, functional testing and various user trials of the bionic arm. Key findings highlight significant improvements in usability and responsiveness compared to traditional prosthetics, demonstrating the potential of EEG integration in assistive technology. This research contributes to the evolving landscape of prosthetic development, offering new insights for individuals requiring upper limb prosthetics.
